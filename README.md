# AnimeList WebAPI Project

This is a webApi that was created using .NET core 6.0. 
It has gone through minor incremental updates to reach this point.

Branches:
- v1.0 -> Initial Api
- v2.0 -> Added Repository pattern + service layer
- v3.0 -> Added CQRS + MediatR implementation
- v3.1 -> Refactoring made for the v3.0 branch (still in progress)
- main -> V3.0 branch

I request for both branch v3.0 and v3.1 to be reviewed in order to see
whether the refactorings made align with clean code.
